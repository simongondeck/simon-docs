## Introduction

ShipBob is a technology-first fulfillment & storage provider for e-commerce merchants. With a distributed network of fulfillment centers across the US, we allow fast, affordable shipping to thousands of customers. Read more about us here.

There are two methods of using this API: a "Personal Access Token (PAT)" for single-merchant or custom integrations, and an OAuth 2.0 process for general-purpose integrations or those that will be listed on ShipBob's App Marketplace.

## Rate Limits

API calls will be rate-limited to 150 requests per-minute using a sliding window, and will be totalled per user, per application across calls to any of the Shipbob APIs.

If you have questions about your limits, please email us at [developers@shipbob.com](mailto:developers@shipbob.com). We'll reply within 1-business day.
