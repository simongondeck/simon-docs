ShipBob's Developer API allows two forms of authentication. The first is a Personal Access Token (PAT) flow, which is used for most requests. The second is a more complex OAuth2 flow, which is used for requests that require user authentication.

## Personal Access Token

If you're building a single-user integration, you can use the PAT method. This generates a ready-to-use bearer-type token with full access to the merchant's account.

The PAT is a simple string that is passed as a query parameter in the URL. It is used for most requests to the API. Your PAT will automatically have read and write access to your entire account.

```http
bearer [your_api_token]
```

## OAuth Flow 

If you're building a multi-user integration, you can use the OAuth2 method. This method requires a few more steps to set up, but it allows you to request access to a merchant's account on their behalf. This is useful if you're building an app that will be used by multiple merchants.

To finish the authentication process, your app will have to do the following:

1. Request a client ID and client secret.
1. Request authorization from a ShipBob user.
1. Retrieve an authorization code from a provided callback.
1. Exchange the authorization code for an access token.
1. Begin making API calls.
